    description:  "Piccadilly Circus is a road junction and public space of London's West End in the City of Westminster. It was built in 1819 to connect Regent Street with Piccadilly. In this context, a circus, from the Latin word meaning circle, is a round open space at a street junction. Its status as a major traffic junction has made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting place and a tourist attraction in its own right. The Circus is particularly known for its video display and neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain and statue of Anteros."

    description:  "Also known as Changuu Island. Overcoming its turbulent history, it has become a must-see jewel of Tanzania with the highlight attraction of being a large home for the giant tortoises. The name Prison Island originated from the initial planning of establishing a prison. It was actually used for a brief time in the 1860s as a prison for rebellious slaves and a coral mine. No prison institutions were actually built on the island but rather became a quarantine station for yellow fever cases."
